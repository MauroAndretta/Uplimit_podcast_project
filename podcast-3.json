AI-generated pseudo books are spamming Amazon and other online bookstores, sometimes borrowing real authors' names to squat on their virtual real estate. Meanwhile, the use of books in the training of AI firms' large language models remains hotly contested as authors seek to prevent unauthorized, uncompensated use of their work. Searches on Amazon are estimated to control at least half of all book sales, and an even bigger share of the growing ebook market are increasingly turning up mediocre AI-generated titles filled with unreliable information and dull composition. Travel guides have become a keenage for this flood-the-zone-with-crud tactic the New York Times reported last week, but AI-generated titles have also begun to infiltrate categories like cooking, programming, gardening, business, crafts, medicine, religion, and mathematics, as well as self-help books and novels, says the Times. It's not always easy for buyers to distinguish these substitute titles from human-written products, which of course contain their share of duds. Reader reviews can help, but the review columns are also beginning to fill up with AI-generated posts intended to skew the ratings. Publishing expert Jane Friedman made headlines last week with a blog post recording her discovery of fake books likely generated by AI that claimed to be written by her and use her name. Amazon responded to her initial protests, she said, by asking whether she had trademarked her own name. The company later took the book listings down after Friedman's posts received attention, as this fraudulent practice spreads, though Friedman wonders what will authors with smaller profiles do when this happens to them. Amazon spokesperson Lindsay Hamilton in a statement said, We have clear content guidelines governing which books can be listed for sale and promptly investigate any book when a concern is raised. Amazon doesn't prohibit AI-generated book content, but works created using AI sometimes intersect with violations, including not complying with intellectual property rights and misleading and disappointing customers. Amazon is constantly evaluating emerging technologies, the spokesperson's statement said, adding they have zero tolerance for fake reviews. The AI boom has given existing stockpiles of book-related data new value to AI developers and made them a target of suspicion for creators. Prostacraft, a project by Benji Smith, the developer of an offering tool called Shakespeare, provided statistical analysis of published books according to characteristics like vividness and uses of the passive voice that also included snippets of books' texts. The database has been around since 2017, but recently authors began to fear that its contents might end up as fuel for AI training. Smith took the site down last week, apologizing to the community of authors and writing that he'd intended the project to put powerful lexicographical tools in the hands of everyday authors. The arrival of AI on the scene has been tainted by early use cases that allow anyone to create zero effort impersonations of artists. Cutting those creators out of their own creative process, Smith wrote, adding that both Prostacraft and Shakespeare were labors of love. The first wave of anxiety about AI focused on ways the technology might steal jobs from humans. But the experience in publishing suggests job market turmoil may be just one of many complex waves of change. We spent significant time examining the impact of AI before making this investment, said KKR's Ted Oberwager, while we believe there will be opportunities to empower editors and creators with technology over time. Just like the typewriter or computer did, we don't see the author at the center of the business model changing. Authors and the human connection and experience will not be replaced. The pollution of virtual bookshelves is obviously bad news for book lovers, but it also poses a threat to the AI world. It's going to be very hard to weed out AI-generated content from the real stuff the AI needs to train on. If too much of the training data is itself AI-generated, studies are already warning the large language models at the heart of AI systems will deteriorate or collapse."}, "podcast_summary": "- AI-generated pseudo books are flooding online bookstores, including Amazon, and using real authors' names without their permission.\n- Training AI models with books is a controversial topic as authors seek to protect their work from unauthorized use.\n- AI-generated titles are infiltrating various book categories, including travel guides, cooking, programming, gardening, business, crafts, medicine, religion, mathematics, self-help, and novels.\n- Differentiating between AI-generated titles and human-written books can be challenging for buyers.\n- Reviews on book listings are being manipulated by AI-generated posts to skew ratings.\n- Publishing expert Jane Friedman discovered fake books generated by AI using her name and had to protest to have them taken down.\n- Amazon has content guidelines, but AI-generated book content can violate intellectual property rights and mislead customers.\n- The value of existing book-related data has increased for AI developers, causing concerns among creators.\n- Prostacraft, a project by Benji Smith, raised fears that its database of book texts could be used for AI training, prompting Smith to take the site down.\n- The arrival of AI in publishing has raised complex challenges beyond just job displacement.\n- The pollution of virtual bookshelves with AI-generated content threatens the accuracy and effectiveness of AI training data.", "podcast_demographic": "- Book lovers and readers\n- Authors and creators\n- AI developers and researchers"}
